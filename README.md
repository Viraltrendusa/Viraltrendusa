Narrator:
"Meet Sarah, an aspiring marathon runner. Two years ago, she couldn't run a mile without gasping for breath. But she had a dream—to cross the marathon finish line. Every morning, she woke up before sunrise, pushing herself through pain, doubt, and countless setbacks. People laughed at her, some said she'd never make it. But Sarah refused to quit. Today, with blistered feet and a determined heart, she crosses the marathon finish line.

Her message? Dreams don’t work unless you do. Failures aren't the end—they're the lessons that pave the way to success."

[Closing Scene: Sarah smiles, holding her medal.]
